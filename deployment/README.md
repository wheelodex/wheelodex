Setup Steps that this Playbook does not Cover
---------------------------------------------
- Provisioning the host
- Assigning the host's DNS
- Setting up SSH access to host
- Creating a dedicated non-root user with sudo privileges and SSH access to use
  for server administration
- Setting the host's locale system-wide to something with UTF-8 encoding (This
  should be redundant in this day & age, and doing it properly involves a
  reboot, so we'd want to keep that out of the playbook)
- Ensuring that Python 3 is installed at `/usr/bin/python3`
- Ensuring that setuptools is installed system-wide for Python 3
