<p>Packaged projects for the <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>
programming language are distributed in two main formats: <em>sdists</em>
(archives of code and other files that require processing before they can be
installed) and <em>wheels</em> (zipfiles of code ready for immediate
installation).  A project's wheel contains the complete information about what
modules, files, &amp; commands the project installs, along with information
about what other projects the project depends on, but <a
href="https://pypi.org">the Python Package Index (PyPI)</a> (where wheels are
distributed) doesn't expose any of this information!  This is the problem that
Wheelodex is here to solve.</p>

<p>Wheelodex scans PyPI for wheel files, analyzes them, and stores &amp;
displays the results.  The site allows users to view the complete metadata
inside wheels, search for wheels containing a given Python module or file,
browse or search for wheels that define a given command or other entry point,
and even find out projects' reverse dependencies.</p>

<p>Note that, in order to save disk space, Wheelodex only records data on
wheels from the latest version of each PyPI project; wheels from older versions
are periodically purged from the database.  Projects' long descriptions aren't
even recorded at all.</p>

<p>Wheelodex was created by John T. Wodder II.  The source code is available on
GitHub at &lt;<a
href="https://github.com/wheelodex/wheelodex">https://github.com/wheelodex/wheelodex</a>&gt;.
Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.</p>
