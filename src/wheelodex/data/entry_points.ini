[console_scripts]
summary = Command-line programs
description =
    `console_scripts` entry points are used by
    [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) and
    [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) to create & install a project's command-line
    programs.  If a project defines a `console_scripts` entry point named `foo`
    that points to `modulename:funcname`, then when the project is installed,
    the installer will also create & install an executable named `foo` that
    invokes `funcname` in `modulename` when run.  [See the setuptools
    documentation for more
    information.](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#automatic-script-creation)

[distutils.commands]
summary = `setup.py` commands
description =
    `distutils.commands` entry points are used by
    [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) to add new commands to
    `setup.py` scripts made with `setuptools.setup()`.  If a project defines a
    `distutils.commands` entry point named `foo` that points to a subclass of
    `setuptools.Command`, then once the project is installed, users will be
    able to run `python setup.py foo` to run the custom command.  [See the
    setuptools documentation for more
    information.](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#adding-commands)

[distutils.setup_keywords]
summary = `setup()` arguments
description =
    `distutils.setup_keywords` entry points are used by
    [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) to add new keyword
    arguments to the `setuptools.setup()` function.  If a project defines a
    `distutils.setup_keywords` entry point named `foo` that points to a
    function, then once the project is installed, `setuptools.setup()` will
    accept a keyword argument named `foo` and will use the given function to
    validate the argument before setting `foo` on the `Distribution` object.
    [See the setuptools documentation for more
    information.](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#adding-setup-arguments)

[egg_info.writers]
summary = `EGG-INFO` files
description =
    `egg_info.writers` entry points are used by
    [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) to create files in
    `<project>.egg-info/` subdirectories in projects & sdists and `EGG-INFO/`
    directories in eggs.  If a project defines an `egg_info.writers` entry
    point named `foo` that points to a function, then once the project is
    installed, running `python setup.py egg_info` will create a file named
    `foo` in `<project>.egg-info/` whose contents are created by the given
    function.  [See the setuptools documentation for more
    information.](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#adding-new-egg-info-files)

    register import order styles.  If a project defines a
    `flake8_import_order.styles` entry point named `foo` that points to a
    subclass of `flake8_import_order.styles.Style`, then once the project is
    installed, users will be able to set `import-order-style` to `foo` to get
    flake8-import-order to check the order of imports in Python code according
    to the given style class.  [See the flake8-import-order documentation for
    more information.](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order)

[flask.commands]
summary = Flask commands
description =
    `flask.commands` entry points are used by
